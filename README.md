# Movie Recommender System

This project implements a movie recommendation system using both content-based and collaborative filtering techniques.

## Datasets

### Content-Based Filtering

For content-based filtering, we use the TMDb movie metadata dataset available on Kaggle. This dataset contains information about movies, such as titles, genres, and posters.

### Collaborative Filtering

For collaborative filtering, we use the MovieLens 25M dataset. This dataset includes user ratings for a large number of movies, which we use to train a recommendation model.
